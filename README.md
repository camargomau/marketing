# Bases de Datos: Final Project, Marketing API

This repository contains the final project that I coded for the Bases de Datos course that's part of [Matémáticas Aplicadas y Computación](https://www.acatlan.unam.mx/index.php?id=31). 

This final project is an Apollo GraphQL API for a Marketing database in MySQL. As of May 22nd 2023, it's still incomplete (it's missing the resolvers for all but 4 tables), but it was left that way since further development was not necessary.
